This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features and specifications. Predicting laptop prices can be beneficial for both consumers and retailers in understanding the market value of a device.

Overview
This repository contains:

Datasets: The dataset used for training and testing the predictive models.
Jupyter Notebooks: Python notebooks detailing data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
Trained Models: Pre-trained models saved for quick inference.

Usage
The notebooks are organized as follows:

Data Preparation: Cleaning, exploring, and preprocessing the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Building: Training machine learning models for price prediction.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics.

Results
Our best-performing model achieved an 80% accuracy in predicting laptop prices. Detailed analysis and insights can be found in the respective notebooks
